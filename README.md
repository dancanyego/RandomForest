# RandomForest
Decision Trees and Random Forests in Python

**Random Forests** are an example of an ensemble method, in which we combine multiple machine learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance. 
Weâ€™ll run multiple models on the data and use the aggregate predictions, which will be better than a single model alone.
Random Forest is one of the most common ensemble methods, which consists of a collection of Decision Trees
